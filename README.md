# FindMusic
The Find Music program allows a user to quickly find music that has been released during the past 48 hours. There are 3 search options: default, search by artist name, and a search that orders the results alphabetically. Currently the only website supported is http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/.

## Future Ideas
* Add links to the music that the user can use to go directly to the song to stream it
* Add links to download locations for the songs that the user can directly access
* Add the ability to search for multiple artists at once
* Support for more websites
* Ability to search for songs by date
* Predictive Search/Autocomplete
* Previous search history storage
* Export to txt or csv
