# FindMusic
The find music program allows a user to specify an artist and website of their choice and the program will scrape the website and return any songs the specified artist appears on for that day. The user can also specify a certain date to search for songs. Currently the only website supported is http://http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ and only songs from the current day are searched. Eventually I'd like for the program to act as a text only way of searching for music that users that are low on data or have slow internet could use to find music for only the artists they care about.

## Things to do
- [x] Finsh the Search class
- [x] Implement the main program that will handle user interaction
- [x] Fix issues
- [ ] Add support for more websites
- [ ] Add the ability to search for songs by date

## Future Ideas
* Add links to the music that the user can use to go directly to the song to stream it
* Add links to download locations for the songs that the user can directly access
* Add the ability to search for multiple artists at once
